# A ROS package for real-time teleoperation of a robotic manipulator (UR3 Cobot)

<b>Overall Functionality</b>: The goal of this project is the development of a ROS-based framework for real-time teleoperation of a robotic manipulator. Currently, the human can control the end effector's position and not the orientation.

<b> Human Input </b>
The interaction is based on visual input. An RGB-D camera is used for the human monitoring and the [Openpose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) project is utilized for the human localization. The wrist pixels are mapped to 3D coordinates expressed in a static reference frame and are used as potential trajectory points for the control of the robot's end effector position. For the acquisition of the 3D RWrist coordinates from the raw RGB image, [this repo](https://github.com/ThanasisTs/openpose_utils) is utilized.

<b> Preprocess of the 3D Human Coordinates </b>: The preprocessing stage of the 3D coordinates consists of 2 methods:
* Removal of outliers and NaN points
* Trajectory smoothing

For the trajectory smoothing, two methods can be used:
* Piecewise Bezier
* Downsamplint - Interpolation

[This repo](https://github.com/ThanasisTs/trajectory_process_utils) provides the utility for the preprocessing stage. The output points of this stage are referred to as <em> trajectory points </em>.

<b> Robot Motion Generation </b>: The motion of the robot's end effector is based on [this repo](https://github.com/ThanasisTs/reactive_control)
